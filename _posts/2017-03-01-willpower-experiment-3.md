## 意志力实验：锻炼意志力

如果你想有一套属于自己的意志力训练方法，不妨试一试下面几个“自控力肌肉”锻炼模式。

* 增强“我不要”的力量：不随便发誓（或者不说某些口头禅）、坐下的时候不跷脚、用不常用的手进行日常活动，比如吃饭和开门。

* 增强“我想要”的力量：每天都做一些事（但不是你已经在做的事），用来养成习惯或不再找借口。你可以给母亲打电话、冥想5分钟，或是每天在家里找出一件需要扔掉或再利用的东西。

* 增强自我监控能力：认真记录一件你平常不关注的事，可以是你的支出、饮食，也可以是你花在上网和看电视上的时间。你不需要太先进的工具，铅笔和纸就够了。但如果你需要一些激励的话，“量化自我”运动（www.quantifiedself.com）已经把“自我记录”变成了一门科学和一种艺术。

本月是三月, 目标是

* 每天至少10个单词, 每天记录之前, 复习一下之前的单词
