Our culture focuses on helping us achieve excellence

Seven Aspects of our Culture

- Values are what we value
- High performance
- Freedom & Responsibility
- Context， not control
- High Aligned， Low Coupled
- Pay top of Market
- Promotions & Development

Many companies have nice sounding value statements displayed in the lobby, such as: Integrity, Communication, Respect, Excellence

The actual company values, as opposed to the nice-sounding values, are shown by who gets rewarded, promoted, or let go

Actual company values are the behaviors and skills that are valued in fellow employees

At Netflix, we particularly value the following nine behaviors and skills in our colleagues

Judgment

* You make wise decisions (people, technical, business, and creative) despite ambiguity
* You identity root causes, and get beyond treating symptoms
* You think strategically, and can articulate what you are, and are not, trying to do
* You smartly separate what must be done well now, and what can be improved later
